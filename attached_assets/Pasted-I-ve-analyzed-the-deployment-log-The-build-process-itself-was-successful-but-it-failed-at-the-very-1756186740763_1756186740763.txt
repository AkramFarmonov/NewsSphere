I've analyzed the deployment log. The build process itself was successful, but it failed at the very last step. The problem is a mismatch between where your files are being built and where Render is looking for them.

This is a common issue when deploying monorepo (multi-folder) projects.

Muammo Tahlili (Nima Sodir Bo'ldi?)
Render's Location: Your Static Site service has its "Root Directory" set to client. This means Render first "enters" the client directory (cd client) before doing anything else.

Build Command's Output: The npm run build command you are using is likely the one from your main package.json. The log shows that this command creates the final frontend files here: ../dist/public/. The ../ means it's creating the dist folder outside the client directory, at the project's root level.

The Conflict: After the build, Render is still inside the client directory. Your "Publish Directory" is set to dist. Render tries to find a folder at client/dist, but that folder doesn't exist because the files were created at the root level (/dist/public). This causes the "Publish directory dist does not exist!" error.

Eng To'g'ri Yechim: Sozlamalarni Monorepoga Moslashtirish
We need to tell the Static Site service to only build the client code and to do it inside the client directory.

1. Kodga Kichik O'zgartirish Kiritish (client/package.json)
Loyihangizning client/package.json faylini oching. Agar unda scripts bo'limi bo'lmasa, uni qo'shing yoki mavjud bo'lsa, build skriptini qo'shing/o'zgartiring. U quyidagicha ko'rinishda bo'lishi kerak:

JSON

{
  // ... boshqa sozlamalar
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build", // SHU QATOR MUHIM
    "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  // ... boshqa sozlamalar
}
Bu o'zgarish client papkasini o'zini-o'zi "build" qilishga o'rgatadi.

2. Render Sozlamalarini To'g'rilash
Endi Render'dagi "realnews-frontend" (Static Site) servisining sozlamalariga kiring va ularni quyidagicha to'g'rilang:

Root Directory: client (Bu o'zgarishsiz qoladi, to'g'ri)

Build Command: npm install && npm run build (Endi bu client papkasidagi build skriptini ishlatadi)

Publish Directory: dist (Bu ham to'g'ri, chunki vite build natijalarni client/dist papkasiga soladi)
